# Smart Home Database 🏠🔗📱

The Smart Home Database (or SHDB) is designed to catalog smart home devices, as well as their intercompatability between devices and software.

Note: Data in the database right now is mostly based off of my own findings, and info such as compatibility may not be 100% accurate. Please, feel free to contribute your own findings!
